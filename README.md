# 98point6_drop_token
This is my answer to the coding challenge for 98point6.
For this challenge, I created two Java files. The GameManage.java is a class for game management, and GameMain.java is the client program of GameManage.java. To run the game, the two files should be put in the same folder, and GameMain.java is the file that should be run. 
Instead of the basic functions in the instructions for the coding challenge and some further implements to deal with invalid inputs, I added an instruction at the beginning of the game, assuming that users are exposed to the game for the first time.
For more information, please see comments in each files.
